## Welcome!

This course is about **quantitative research designs** applied to **public opinion and policy**

. . .

- **Quantitative:** Data analysis using statistics and statistical programming software

. . .

- **Research design:** Thinking about how research is conducted

## Welcome! {visibility="uncounted"}

This course is about **quantitative research designs** applied to **public opinion and policy**

- **Public opinion:** Views among the general^[Sometimes not so general] public

. . .

- **(Public) policy:** Government actions and how to carry them

## Why public opinion and policy?

. . .

- Both are important for the operation of government and adjacent organizations

. . .

- Why ***together***?

. . .

- Both are important and difficult/expensive to get right

. . .

- Minimize mistakes **before** conducting a study

## Was this a mistake?

![No wrong answers!](figs/arrivecan.png){fig-align="center"}

## Content warning {{< fa skull-crossbones >}}

- We will rely heavily on **math** and **statistics** to think about the properties of a research design

. . .

- You will be asked to:

    - Read technical writing
    - Understand and explain statistical concepts
    - Apply them in writing and coding
    - Write a statistics-heavy final project

## Software

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)

![](figs/rstudio_ide.png){fig-align="center"}

## Computer access

- You will need a computer to work on during our weekly meetings and beyond

- R + RStudio works on most laptops and has a cloud option

- See [popw23.gustavodiaz.org/resources.html](https://popw23.gustavodiaz.org/resources.html) for installation guides

- Computers in the classroom should have the most recent version

- Computer labs open to students whenever courses are not scheduled [{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](https://uts.mcmaster.ca/services/teaching-and-learning/computer-labs/)
