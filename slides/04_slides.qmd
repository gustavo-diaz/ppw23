## Announcements {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

- Groups put in contact yesterday

- Topic is highly negotiable

- Don't forget to schedule a meeting before break!

## Last week {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Elements of models `(signature, functional relations, probability distributions)`

- **Panel surveys:** Good for understanding before-after effects, expensive to conduct

## Today {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Elements of **data strategies** and **answer strategies**

- Research designs for sensitive questions

- **Lab:** Practice writing research designs on your own

# Data and Answer Strategies {background-color="#FDBF57"}
:::

## Elements of a data strategy

::: incremental
1. Sampling `(random, nonrandom)`

2. Treatment assignment `(if applicable)`

3. Measurement `(validity, reliability)`
:::

## Measurement as multiple independent draws

![](figs/darts_validity.png){fig-align="center"}

## Elements of an answer strategy

::: incremental
1. Answer characterization `(domain, units, outcomes, conditions)`

2. Uncertainty `(Bayesian, frequentist)`

3. Procedure `(e.g. OLS, difference-in-means)`
:::

## Types of answer strategies

. . .

1. Point estimation 

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
### Example

- What is the proportion of French speakers?

- What is the effect of taking a political science course on political interest?

# Sensitive Questions {background-color="#FDBF57"}
:::

## Why do people lie in surveys?

::: incremental


1. Inattention

2. Satisficing

3. Limited options

4. Demand effects

5. Social desirability/sensitivity bias

4. [Demand effects]{style="color: gray;"} 

5. [**Social desirability/sensitivity bias**]{style="color: #ac1455;"} 

## How to prevent lying?

::: incremental

- Add noise to the question

- Two approaches:

1. Distract from the sensitive attitude/behavior

2. Guarantee anonymity

- Different designs vary on how they combine the two
:::

## Randomized response

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

. . .

&nbsp;

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

. . .

&nbsp;

Now you throw the dice so that I cannot see what comes out.

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

&nbsp;

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

&nbsp;

Have you thrown the dice?

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

&nbsp;

[TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]

&nbsp;

Have you picked it up?

## Randomized response {visibility="uncounted"}

For this question, I want you to answer *yes* or *no*. But I want you to consider the number of your dice throw. If {{< fa dice-one >}} shows on the dice, tell me *no*. If {{< fa dice-six >}} shows, tell me *yes*. But if another number shows, tell me your own opinion about the question.

&nbsp;

Now, during the height of the conflict in 2007 and 2008 *(in Afghanistan)*, did you know any militants, like a family member, a friend, or someone you talked to on a regular basis? 

. . .

Please, before you answer, take note of the number you rolled on the dice.

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- We know that about $1/6 \approx 0.17$ respondents said *yes* because they rolled a {{< fa dice-six >}}

- So if $30\%$ in total said *yes*

- We have $\widehat{Y} = 0.3 - 0.17 = 0.13$ as our estimate of the proportion of the population who know a member of a militant organization

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

:::

## Assumptions

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 1. Honesty given protection

People respond honestly when guaranteed anonymity.

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 2. One-sided lying

Those who **do not** hold the sensitive trait **never** falsely claim to bear it.

:::

. . .

- These cannot be verified with data!

## List experiment

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. I don't want to know which ones, just HOW MANY.

. . .

### Control group

::: incremental
1. The federal government increasing the tax on gasoline
2. Professional athletes getting million-dollar contracts
3. Large corporations polluting the environment

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Now I am going to read you three things that make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. I don't want to know which ones, just HOW MANY.

### Treatment group

1. The federal government increasing the tax on gasoline
2. Professional athletes getting million-dollar contracts
3. Large corporations polluting the environment
4. **A black family moving next door**

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- Respondents are randomly assigned to conditions

- Differences in responses can only be attributed to the presence/absence of the sensitive item

- So $\widehat{Y} = \text{Mean(treatment)} - \text{Mean(control)})$ estimates the proportion in the population of interest who would get upset if a black family moves next door

- But we **do not know** who they are in our survey!

:::

## Assumptions

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 1. No liars

Those who **do not** hold the sensitive item **never** falsely claim to bear it.

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### 2. No design effects

Including the sensitive item **does not change** how participants respond to the baseline items

:::

. . .

- These can only be evaluated **indirectly**



## Other research designs

::: incremental

- Building trust with respondents

- [Endorsement experiments](https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpr031)

- [Conjoint experiments](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2021.30)

- [Network scale-up method](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1935267)
