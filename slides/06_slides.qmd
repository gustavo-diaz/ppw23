## Convenience Samples {.center background-color="#ac1455"}

&nbsp;

**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2023
:::

## Course so far {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Representative surveys as the gold standard

- Other research design help us learn more but tend to use convenience samples

- **Today:** Talk more about convenience samples

## We are seeing less of this

![](figs/ces_logo.png){fig-align="center"}

## And more of this

![](figs/mturk.png){fig-align="center"}

## And more of this {visibility="uncounted"}

![](figs/prolific.png){fig-align="center"}

## And more of this {visibility="uncounted"}

![](figs/cint.png){fig-align="center"}

## Do we want surveys to be representative?

::: incremental

- Pros?

- Cons?

- We always want them!

- But when do we **need** them?

- Rather, when can we **get away** with not having them?

## Internal an external validity

::: incremental

- **Validity:** Approximate truth or usefulness of an *inference*

- **Inference:** How we interpret the results of a study

- **Internal validity:** Whether inferences from a single study *cannot* be explained by other factors

- **External validity:** Whether inferences from a single study apply to a broader population or other target populations

- Convenience samples make it *easier* to achieve *internal validity* at the *expense* of *external validity* 

:::

## Types of internal validity

1. X-validity `(endogenous variables)`

2. T-validity `(treatments, conditions)`

3. Y-validity `(outcome variables)`

4. C-validity `(context)`

:::

## X-validity

::: incremental
- Is the sample comparable to the target population?

- If not, can we claim that the differences can be ignored?

- To do that, we have to convince ourselves that:
:::

. . .

1. Effects are the same across units

. . .

OR

. . .

2. We observe all the variables that may explain discrepancies in effects

## T-validity

::: incremental
- Do treatments `(conditions)` reflect what participants would encounter in the real world? 

- **Example:** Is thinking about *hypothetical* countries a good reflection to how people would think about *real* countries?

- Can we claim that there are no different versions of the same *treatment*?

- To do that, we need to convince ourselves that everyone would interpret vignettes in the same way

- Either because it is **realistic** enough or abstract yet **believable**
:::

## Y-validity

::: incremental
- Do the outcomes we measure in surveys reflect the outcomes we want to learn about in the real world?

- **Example:** Are self-reported vote intentions a good replacement for actual voting behavior?

- Can we claim that there are no different versions of the same *outcome*?

- Need to convince ourselves that measured outcomes are sufficiently valid and reliable

:::

## C-validity

::: incremental
- Do results generalize from other contexts?

- **Example:** If it worked with students in Sweden, will it work with students in Canada?

- Can we claim that the same units would react in the same way if the study was conducted elsewhere?

- Need to convince ourselves that **context is irrelevant** for *similar people* in *different places*

# Discussion {background-color="#FDBF57"}

## Munger et al (2021): Accessibility and generalizability

::: incremental

- Replicate 3 convenience sample survey experiments with representative sample

1. Social commentary and news source credibility

2. Facebook shares and news consumption

3. Issue framing and support for gun control

- **Argument:** Effects vary considerably by age and digital literacy

:::

## Findings

::: incremental

- **Replication 1:** Participants low on digital literacy did not respond differently to vignettes

- **Replication 2:** Older people clicked on whatever headline came first

- **Replication 3:** No differences because issue had nothing to do with digital literacy

- What kind of validity is this about?

:::

## Coppock et al (2018): Generalizability of heterogeneous treatment effect estimates across samples

::: incremental
- Replicate 27 studies from nationally-representative samples with convenience samples

- Compare how effects vary across 16 demographic characteristics

:::

![](figs/coppock_1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Explanation

::: incremental

- Different samples yield similar results when:

1. Treatment effects are mostly homogeneous

2. Effect heterogeneity is **orthogonal** to sample selection

- What type of validity is this about?
