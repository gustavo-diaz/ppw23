## Representative Surveys {.center background-color="#ac1455"}

&nbsp;

**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2023
:::

## Announcements {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

- Class will now start at 9 AM instead of 8:30 AM

- I received accommodation letters. Schedule a meeting if you need anything beyond extra time for completing assignments

- Uploaded a template for response papers [DO THIS]

- Sign-up for final project groups will start at [TIME]. Check course website for link.

## Last week {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Overview of course topic, goals, evaluation, expectations

- We installed R and RStudio and explored them a bit

- Cloud option always available if all else fails

- More details in the [course website {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}}](https://popw23.gustavodiaz.org/)

## Today {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Overview of the MIDA research design workflow

- Start the topic of public opinion

- Representative surveys as the standard design

- **Takeaway:** Complete random sampling is the gold standard but too hard to apply in realistic settings

- **Discussion:** Canadian Election Study

- **{{< fa laptop-code >}} Lab:** Intro to R + Sampling from populations

# Research Design {background-color="#FDBF57"}

## What is a research design?

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}} RD:** A procedure for generating answers to questions

- **More generally:** Thinking about how research is (was, will be) conducted

- **Emphasis:** We can **program** and **interrogate** elements of a research design

:::

## Elements of research design

::: incremental

1. **Model *(M)* **

2. **Inquiry *(I)* **

3. **Data strategy *(D)* **

4. **Answer strategy *(A)* **

:::

## Model

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** A **set** of **speculations** about **what causes what** and **how**

- **Set:** We consider many models because we are uncertain of how the world works

- **Speculation:** All models are wrong, some models are useful

- **What causes what:** Informs the *event generating process* (e.g. distributions, correlations)

- **How:** An explanation of why things are connected or correlated

:::

## Examples of models? {.center}

::: footer
**Hint:** Models are also called theories (of change), arguments, claims, beliefs, epistemologies, ideologies, hunches, conjecture
:::
:::

## Inquiry

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** A research question stated in terms of the model

- In this course, we will talk about **quantities of interest** or **estimands**^[Estimands, estimators, and estimates are different things with annoyingly similar names. We will return to this in a few weeks.]

- Some questions will lend themselves to multiple inquiries. We will tend to focus on those with one or a handful


:::

## Examples of inquiries

1. What is the proportion of unemployed people in the country?
    
2. What is the effect of immigration on economic development?
    
3. Do people support funding private clinics to mitigate surgery backlogs?
    
4. Will the stock market crash this year?

5. Individual causal effect $\tau_i = Y_{i}(1)-Y_{i}(0)$

## Data strategy

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** Set of **procedures** used to **gather information** from the world

- Three features:

    1. How *units* are selected
    
    2. How *conditions* are assigned^[This will make more sense as we start thinking about cause and effect.]
    
    3. How *outcomes* are measured

:::

## Answer strategy

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** How we summarize the data produced by the data strategy

- Data *is* **too complicated** to speak for itself

- Needs summary and explanation

- Most **research methods** qualify as **answer strategies** `(Examples?)`

## Public opinion

::: incremental
- The study of self-reported **attitudes** and **behaviors**

- Primarily **among general public**

- **Goal:** Mapping **self-reports** to **actual** attitudes and behaviors

## Two challenges
