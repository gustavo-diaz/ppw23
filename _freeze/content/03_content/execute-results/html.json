Sometimes these repeat the same questions to understand shifts in public opinion and the effect of events in between waves.\n\nAs with last week, the takeaway is that panel surveys are expensive and risk missing subjects across waves, this is called panel attrition. With fixed budgets, one may wonder if we are better off just conducting a one-shot survey, also called a cross-section with an increased sample size.\n\nWe have no new lab assignment this week. Instead, we will spend some time revisiting the lab from last week. I plan to spend some time comparing one-shot and panel surveys with simulations.\n\n## Reading\n\n- [{{< fa book >}}]{style=\"color: #ac1455;\"} [RD sections 5-7, 15](https://book.declaredesign.org/declaring-designs.html) \n\n- [{{< fa file-lines >}}]{style=\"color: #ac1455;\"} Esaiasson, Peter and Mikael Persson. 2014.
