## Panel Surveys {.center background-color="#ac1455"}

&nbsp;

**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2023
:::

## Announcements {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

- Lab 2 deadline extended to Friday, January 27 `(no new lab today)`

- [Sign up for groups!](https://forms.gle/6MpV3XfQjpvCd2pS6)

- By 9 AM tomorrow or I will put you wherever {{< fa face-angry >}}

## Last week {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Overview of **MIDA** approach to research design as programming

- **Representative surveys** as the gold standard of public opinion research

- Challenging to decide:

    - What to ask
    - Who to ask
    
- **Lab:** Get to know R, practice simulating a survey with random sampling

## Today {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Start thinking about **cause and effect**

- **Panel surveys:** Survey the same sample multiple times

- **Lab:** Revisit last week's lab

# Cause and Effect {background-color="#FDBF57"}
:::

## Elements of a model {{< fa book >}}

. . .

1. Signature

2. Functional relations

3. Probability distribution over exogenous variables

## Part 1: Signature

::: incremental

- **{{< fa book >}}:** Describes variables and their ranges

- Two kinds of variables

- **Endogenous:** Generated from *within* the model

- **Exogenous:** Generated from *without* the model

:::

## Types of exogenous variables

::: incremental

1. Anything explicitly (or assumed as) **randomized** 

    - Mostly experimental treatment assignment
    
    - Denoted by $Z$
    
2. Anything **unobserved** by the model

    - Otherwise we would be in trouble!
    
    - Denoted by $U$
    
:::

## Types of endogenous variables

- Anything else

::: incremental

- **Outcomes:** The things we ultimately want to understand ($Y$)

- **Moderators:** Variables that modify effects ($X$)

- **Mediators:** How or why something has an effect ($X$)

- **Confounders:** Introduce non-causal dependence ($X$)

:::

## Part 2: Functional relations

::: incremental
- **{{< fa book >}}:** Set of **functions** that produce endogenous variables

- Two ways to express functional relations

1. **Structural causal models** `(today)`

2. **Potential outcomes framework** `(next week)`

:::

## Structural causal models

- Use **D**irected **A**cyclic **G**raphs `(DAGs)`

::: incremental

- **Directed:** Connected by arrows

- **Acyclic:** Not cyclical, usually end in outcomes

- **Graphs:** Visual representation as *nodes* and *edges*

- They represent **nonparametric** causal models
:::

## Example

```{r, results = "asis", fig.cap = "DAG for $Y = f_y(Z,U)$"}
dag = dagify(Y ~ Z + U,
             exposure = "Z",
             outcome = "Y",
             labels = c(
               "Y" = "Outcome",
               "Z" = "Treatment assignment",
               "U" = "Unknown heterogeneity"),
             coords = data.frame(
               x = c(1, 0, 1),
               y = c(0, 0, 1),
               name = c("Y", "Z", "U")
             ))

ggdag(dag, use_labels = "label", 
      node_size = 20, text_size = 5)
```

## Part 3: Probability distribution over exogenous variables

- An explanation of how exogenous variables are generated

. . .

### Examples

. . .

- $Z \sim \text{Bern}(p)$ with $p = 0.1$

. . .

- $U \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$

# Panel Surveys {background-color="#FDBF57"}
:::

## What are panel surveys?

::: incremental

- Surveys where the same participants are asked questions at multiple points in time

- Usually measure **outcomes** at every time `(but not necessary)`

- More common among *convenience samples* `(e.g. students, twins)`

- The name comes from their **data structure**

:::

## Panel data

```{r bal_panel}
bal_panel = data.frame(
  ID = c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3)),
  year = rep(c(2016, 2017, 2018), 2),
  income = c(1300, 1600, 2000, 2000, 2300, 2400),
  age = c(27, 28, 29, 38, 39, 40),
  sex = c(rep("M", 3), rep("F", 3))
)

bal_panel %>% kable(caption = "Balanced panel")
```

## Panel data

```{r unbal_panel}
unbal_panel = data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3),
  year = c(2016, 2017, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2017),
  income = c(1600, 1500, 1900, 2000, 2100, 3300),
  age = c(23, 24, 41, 42, 43, 34),
  sex = c("M", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M")
)

unbal_panel %>% kable(caption = "Unbalanced panel")
```

## What are panel surveys for?

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=1}
1. To measure attitudes in a population over time
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}
2. To understand the effect of events occurring between waves
:::

## Challenge

::: incremental

- **Panel attrition:** Participants may drop out from follow up waves

- It may offset the benefit of conducting a panel survey

- It may depend on factors relevant to the study

### Sensitive Questions

**Focus on:** Which research design seems more appropriate to elicit honest answers?
