## Evidence-Informed Policy {.center background-color="#ac1455"}

&nbsp;

**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2023
:::

## Policy

::: incremental

- **Policy** is an umbrella term to describe government programs or operations at different levels

- **Examples:**

    - How long should form 57B be?
    
    - Should we get help from private clinics to clear surgey backlogs?
    
    - Should the education budget increase?
    
    - When should the next federal election be held?

:::

## Evidence-Informed

::: incremental
- Of course we want to base policy on evidence!

- But there is no *objective* evidence when it comes to human behavior

- We say evidence-*informed* because the best we can do is try to prove ourselves wrong, but we cannot *base* policy on evidence the same way medicine does

:::

## Two approaches

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=1}
1. Evidence as **insight**
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}
2. Evidence as **evaluation**
:::

# How can you determine if a policy works?

## Example

![](figs/fisher_book.png){fig-align="center"}

## The lady tasting tea

. . . 

*A lady declares that by tasting a cup of tea made with milk she can discriminate whether the milk or the tea infusion was first added to the cup*

. . .

&nbsp;

::: {style="text-align: center"}
How do you **evaluate** this claim?
:::

## An experiment

::: incremental
- Suppose we have eight milk tea cups

- 4 milk first, 4 tea first

- We arrange them in random order

- Lady knows there are 4 of each, but not which ones
:::

## Results

```{r}
tea = tribble(
  ~Lady, ~Tea, ~Milk,
  "Tea", 3, 1,
  "Milk", 1, 3
)

tea = tea %>% mutate(
  Lady = ifelse(Lady == "Tea", 
                "Tea First",
                "Milk First"))

colnames(tea) = c("Lady's Guesses", "Tea First", "Milk First")

tea %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "True Order" = 2))
```

::: incremental
- She gets it right $6/8$ times

- What can we conclude?
:::


## Problem

::: incremental
- How does "being able to discriminate" look like?

- Same for policy, we don't know how the world where the policy works look like

- But we **do know** how a person without the ability to discriminate milk/tea order looks like

- This lets us make **probability statements** about this **hypothetical world of no effect** 
:::

## A person with no ability

```{r}
nulldist = tribble(
  ~count, ~combinations, ~number,
  0, "xxxx", "\\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)",
  1, "xxxo, xxox, xoxx, oxxx", "\\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)", 
  2, "xxoo, xoxo, xoox, oxox, ooxx, oxxo", "\\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)",
  3, "xooo, oxoo, ooxo, ooox", "\\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)",
  4, "oooo", "\\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)"
)

colnames(nulldist) = c("Count", "Possible combinations", "Total")

nulldist %>% 
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>% 
  column_spec(3, color = "white")
  
```

. . .

- We can repeat this for both successes and failures


## A person with no ability {visiblity="uncounted"}

```{r}
nulldist %>% 
  kbl(escape = FALSE)
```

::: incremental
- A person just guessing gets $6/8$ cups right with probability $\frac{16}{70} \approx 0.23$
- And **at least** $6/8$ cups with $\frac{16 + 1}{70} \approx 0.24$
:::

## p-values

::: incremental
- If the lady is not able to discriminate milk-tea order, the chance of observing 6/8 correct guesses or better is 24%

- We can translate this to general statements about policies or experiments

- If the **null hypothesis** of no effect is true...

- ... the **p-value** is the probability of observing a result *equal or more extreme* than what is originally observed

- Smaller p-values give more evidence **against** the null, which helps us make a case for the policy having an effect

:::

## Diagnosing hypothesis tests

::: incremental

- A convention in the social sciences is to claim that something with $p < 0.05$ is *statistically significant*^[There is no good reason for this other than path dependency]

- Committing to a **significance level** implies accepting that sometimes we will get $p < 0.05$ by chance

- This is a **false positive** result

- A good answer strategy as a **controlled** false positive rate  `(more in the lab!)`
