## Field Experiments I {.center background-color="#ac1455"}

**POLSCI 4SS3**  
Winter 2023
:::

## Last time {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- Hypothesis testing as a standard to evaluate if experiments suggest that policies works

- We don't know how things look when the policy work, but we can contrast with the hypothetical world in which it doesn't work

- We can only do this if we know how the experiment was conducted!

- **Lab:** Statistical power as a diagnosand to determine if an experiment is well equipped to detect "true" effects

- **Today:** Start applying these concepts to **field experiments**

## Field Experiments

::: incremental

- **Field:** Interventions in real world settings `(vs. surveys, laboratory)`

- **Experiment:** Randomization determines assignment of units to conditions

- AKA *randomized controlled trials* in policy or *A/B testing* in industry

- **Core idea:** Randomization allows us to produce credible evidence on whether something works

- **In practice:** A lot of implementation details and research design choices to navigate

# Examples

## Banerjee et al (2021): TUP program

::: incremental

- **Poverty trap:** Most programs to help the poor improve living conditions in the short term, but revert afterwards

- **Solution:** Multidimensional "big push" to overcome poverty traps

- Evaluate long-term effect on poorest villages in West Bengal, India

## Household eligibility criteria

. . .

1. Able bodied female member `(why?)`
2. No credit access

. . . 

**AND** at least three out of

. . .

1. Below 0.2 acres of land `(about 2 basketball courts)`
2. No productive assets
3. No able-bodied male member
4. Kids who work instead of going to school
5. No formal source of income

## Data strategy

- **Sample:** 978 eligible households

- 514 **assigned** to treatment

- 266 **accepted** treatment 

. . .

&nbsp;

::: {style="text-align: center"}
What was the treatment?
:::

## Program

- Choose a productive asset `(82% chose livestock)`

- Weekly consumption support for 30â€“40 weeks

- Access to savings

- Weekly visits from program staff over a span of 18 months

. . .

&nbsp;

::: {style="text-align: center"}
Why would someone reject this?
:::

## Answer strategy

::: incremental
- Track economic and health outcomes after 18 months, 3, 7, and 10 years

- Of all household members

- Focus on average treatment effect **among the treated** `(more in the lab)`
:::

## Findings

![](figs/8_tup_1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Why does this work?

```{r}
tup_tab = data.frame(
  Time = c("18 months", "3 years", "7 years", "10 years"),
  Livestock = c(10.26, 7.68, 27.26, 16.71),
  Micro = c(7.93, 25.12, 67.59, 36.82),
  Self = c(18.67, 31.06, 108.36, 93.87),
  Remittances = c(0.00, 3.70, 8.87, 19.06)
)
colnames(tup_tab) = c("Time", "Livestock", "Micro-enterprise", "Self-employment", "Remittances")

tup_tab %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "ATE on income from..." = 4))
  
```

. . .

- **Takeaway:** Big push works because it helps people diversify their income sources over time

## Pennycook et al (2021): Shifting attention to accuracy can reduce misinformation online

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
- Why do people share fake news in social media?
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Three explanations:

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=3}
1. Confusion about accuracy
:::

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=3}
2. Partisanship $>$ accuracy
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=3}
3. Inattention to accuracy

## Study 7: Application to Twitter

::: incremental
- Studies 1-7 were all survey experiments

- Study 7 deploys intervention on Twitter to see if priming accuracy works

- N = 5,739 users who previously shared news from untrustworthy sources

- **Treatment:** Send a DM asking to evaluate accuracy of news article
:::

## Challenge to data strategy

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
- Can only send DM to someone who follows you

- Need to create bot accounts and hope for follow-backs

- Identify those who retweet fake news

- Limit 20 DMs per account per day

- 3 waves with many 24-hour blocks in each
