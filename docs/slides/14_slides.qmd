Winter 2023
:::

## Course surveys due April 12, 11:59 PM {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

![](figs/course_evals.png){fig-align="center"}

## Announcements {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

- Final projects due **April 21**

- Groups need to meet with instructor one more time before **April 19** `(Otherwise your group meeting grade is F)`

- Extra office hour times **April 13-19**

- Every group member needs to be in **at least one** group meeting to receive the group meeting grade



## Last time {background-color="#FDBF57"}

- **Quasi-experiments:** Observational answer strategies for causal inquiries

```{r}
types = tribble(
  ~Inquiry, ~Observational, ~Experimental,
  "Descriptive", "Sample survey", "List experiment",
  "Causal", "Quasi-experiment", "Survey/field experiment"
)

types %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Data strategy" = 2)) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  column_spec(2, bold = c(FALSE, TRUE))
```

. . .

- RDD as an example of quasi-experiment

- **Today:** Difference-in-differences as another common example in public policy

# Difference-in-differences {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

## Reminder

- Critiques to causal claims from observational data

. . .

1. Reverse causation

2. Omitted variable bias

3. Selection bias

. . .

- Need creativity to rule these out

## Difference-in-differences design

::: incremental
- *At least* two groups or conditions `(treatment,control)`

- *At least* two time periods `(pre- and post-treatment)`

- Once treated, units **stay on**

- We accept that selection bias is unavoidable

- But comparing before-after changes between groups allows us to calculate treatment effect

## Diff-in-diffs estimator

```{r}
dd = tribble(
  ~Group, ~Before, ~After,
  "Treatment", "A", "B",
  "Control", "C", "D"
)

dd %>% 
  kbl(align = "lcc") %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Timing" = 2))
```

. . .

$$
\widehat{ATE} =  [\text{Mean}(B) - \text{Mean}(A)] - [\text{Mean}(D) - \text{Mean}(C)]
$$

## Diff-in-diffs estimator {visibility="uncounted"}

```{r}
dd %>% 
  kbl(align = "lcc") %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Timing" = 2))

$$
\widehat{ATE} =  \underbrace{[\text{Mean}(B) - \text{Mean}(A)]}_\text{Difference} - \underbrace{[\text{Mean}(D) - \text{Mean}(C)]}_\text{Difference}
$$

::: aside
Assuming the treatment group follows the dotted line absent treatment, the difference in difference estimator recovers the causal effect
:::

## Assumption

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
### Parallel trends
- Treatment and control may have different values before treatment

- Absent treatment, the treatment group would have changed like the control group

:::

::: incremental
- This is equivalent to claiming that treatment and control, while different, follow a similar trajectory

- Ideally, you justify by observing the outcome over many pre-treatment periods

## Variants of the design

::: incremental
- Many groups, treatments, time periods

- **Increasingly common:** Units become treated at different time periods

- **Example:** Policy adopted by cities over a time period

- This makes similar to a **staggered adoption** design

- But things get very complicated *without randomization*
:::

## Multiple treatment periods

![](figs/dd_timing.png)

::: aside
Effects are positive first, negative later. The average of the two cancels out, but the policy clearly has an effect!
:::

# Example {background-color="#8BD3E6"}

## Leininger et al (2023)

### Temporary disenfranchisement in Germany

::: incremental
- Discrepancies of minimum voting age across elections `(municipal, state, national)`

- 16-17 year olds in Schleswig-Holstein can vote in local but not national elections

- **Temporary disenfranchisement** may push voters away from democracy
:::

## Research design

![](figs/leininger_1.png)

. . .

- **Outcomes:** Survey questions about internal/external efficacy, satisfaction with democracy, political interest
