A response paper is a short form document that summarizes the question, relevance, and research design of a study and then uses the course material to critically evaluate an aspect of its design or implementation. The main task is to identify questions and issues that require our attention during the discussion portion of our weekly meeting. You are expected to engage actively during class discussion in the weeks you write a response paper. In weeks with multiple assigned papers, you can choose whichever you prefer to discuss. The course website contains a template with guidelines on how to write a response paper for this course. Response papers are due 24 hours before our class meeting.\nResponse papers should be between 700 and 1,000 words. You are required to complete at least 3 response papers, if you choose to complete more, only the best three will count towards your final grade (10% each)."

The minimum number of meetings required may change based on roster size.\nIn the first meeting, we will discuss project ideas and identify elements of the course material that you should pay attention to. In subsequent meetings, you should submit a document outlining your current progress 24 hours before the meeting time. This can be a either working draft of your final project or a separate document altogether. The purpose of this exercise is for you to get continuous feedback on writing a pre-analysis plan. Based on the specifics of your project, I may ask you to schedule additional meetings. You are also welcomed to schedule additional meetings if you deem it necessary.\nFinal project meetings count for 10% of your total grade. This grade will be updated after every meeting and should serve as an indication of the work required to receive a satisfactory score in your final project. Not all group members need to attend a meeting, but every group member should attend at least one meeting."

This is a document that outlines the steps of a future study that addresses a novel question of academic interest or policy/industry relevance. This document identifies a problem or question that needs to be addressed, explains its relevance or novelty, proposes a research design, and evaluates its properties to guide implementation. The course website will host resources to write a pre-analysis plan, and we will discuss expectations throughout the semester. Final projects should range from 5,000 to 6,000 words.\nDuring the first week of our course, you will complete a survey to share details about your research interests and career goals. Based on your answers, I will create research themes that students can sign up to form groups on a first-come first-served basis. I anticipate groups of 3-4 people. The details of group formation will change depending on interests and roster size.\nIf you already have a research topic you want to work on, you may choose to write an individual project instead. However, note that the expectations are the same as if you were working with a group. You should consult with me as early as possible to determine if your individual project suits the course objectives. The instructor reserves the right to accept or reject individual project proposals."

With fixed budgets, one may wonder if we are better off just conducting a one-shot survey, also called a cross-section with an increased sample size.\nWe have no new lab assignment this week.

    "text": "When surveys deal with sensitive topics, there is a chance that respondents conceal the truth in their answers. We call this sensitivity bias. This week, we review research designs that seek to reduce sensitivity biases by asking sensitive questions indirectly. Asking indirect questions takes attention away from the sensitive attitude of interest and ensures respondent anonymity.\nThe takeaway for this week is that these techniques reduce sensitivity bias, but they do so at the expense of statistical precision, so they may not always improve our ability to measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors. We illustrate this point in the lab."

I expect our class discussions to start from the main findings of a study and then work backwards to understand how a study was conducted and why it was done so in a certain why.\nThis means that you may have to pay extra attention to things that you tend to ignore when reading for other courses. My advice is to try to read strategically. I find this guide by Amelia Hoover Green useful.\nI find myself at odds about assigning readings with a lot of math. On the one hand, I find equations useful to talk about general design ideas that we can then translate to specific research contexts. On the other hand, I got into political science because I wanted to avoid math as much as possible (it didn’t work), which means I have to fight my natural inclination of skipping all the formulas formulae formulæ.\nOver time, I have learned that the problem is not so much the math, but the language attached to it. Academic articles often expect the audience to be an insider that already knows how to read the math, so they skip the plain language explanation. I find it useful to try to rewrite equations in words as I take notes, but that takes time that you may not have.\nI plan to use some of our class time clarifying important quantities of with words and coding examples."

    "text": "Description \nThis course explores quantitative research designs to answer questions about public opinion and policy in academia, government, and industry. We will examine how to conduct surveys to understand variation in public opinion or attitudes toward several subjects across the world. We will also examine empirical strategies to generate credible evidence to inform policy decisions in different contexts.\nThe main learning objective of this course to develop standards to think about the appropriate research design before conducting a study. This is useful to those working with quantitative data either directly or indirectly. We will work towards that goal through a combination of reading, discussion, and hands-on practice.\nStudents will have the opportunity to practice working with statistical software in preparation to write a pre-analysis plan document that outlines the steps of a future study that addresses a novel question of academic interest or policy/industry relevance.\nThis course contributes to the Research Methods and/or Analysis requirement for the Concurrent Certificate in Applied Social Sciences Research. As such, it relies heavily on statistics as the main tool to think about research design. Students are expected to have taken at least POLSCI 4NN3 – Statistical Analysis or have equivalent experience with statistics and statistical programming software. I expect us to understand the main findings of a quantitative social science study and work backwards from there to understand the research design choices that researchers made. I also expect, but not assume, some experience with loading, cleaning, and analyzing data."

Forthcoming at Princeton University Press\n\nYou can read the digital copy of the book for free by using the link above. The physical version is not available for purchase yet. The rest of the syllabus refers to this book with the initials RD.\nThe companion textbook is:\n\nGrolemund, Garret and Hadley Wickham. 2017. R for Data Science. O’Reilly Media Inc\n\nOnce again, you can read the digital copy of this book for free with the link above. You are not required to read this book for this course but consulting it on occasion may help you overcome hurdles while working with statistical software. Since the digital version is constantly updated, I do not recommend buying a physical copy.\nWe will also read academic papers that discuss or apply the research designs we will cover. Most of these are available through the library’s subscription. See this link for instructions to access library resources while off campus. If not available through the library or elsewhere online, I will upload them to the course website.\n\n\nSoftware\nWe will use R and RStudio to program research designs and evaluate their properties. The advantage of R is that it is free and open source, meaning that you will be able to apply everything you learn in this course anywhere else. The disadvantage is a somewhat steep learning curve. I believe the investment is worthwhile for anyone working with data or in data-adjacent careers.\nThe computers in our classroom should have a recent installation of both programs. While I expect us to spend some class meeting time working with R, you will most likely need access to the software outside of the classroom. You are welcome to bring a laptop to class.\nYou can install R and RStudio in your personal computer. You can use this link for installation instructions on Windows and MacOS (ignore the parts about package building). See this link for installation instructions on Chromebooks, which is a bit more involved.\nYou can also use Posit Cloud to access RStudio from any web browser. A free account should be sufficient for the purposes of this course and has the advantage of letting you access your work across devices.\nYou should reach out to the instructor if you foresee any challenges with accessing computing resources outside of the classroom."

    "text": "Policies\n\nSubmitting assignments\nPrompts for assignments will be available in the course website. You should upload assignments via Avenue.\nAssignments should use the author-date citation style of the Chicago Manual of Style. You do not need to include citations for the weekly lab assignments, but you can do so if you wish.\nYou can use the templates available in the course website to format your assignments, slight modifications within RStudio are acceptable. If you write assignments outside RStudio, they should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1-inch margins. Assignments do not require a cover sheet. Figures, tables, and bibliography are not part of word counts. You can use this tool to count words in PDF documents.\n\n\nLate assignments\nIn this course, assignments are designed to be cumulative; each assignment builds on the last. For this reason, it is important to not fall behind and to complete assignments on time. Assignments turned in within one hour of the due date will only be eligible for 95% of the total value. Assignments turned after one hour but within 24 hours of the due date will be eligible for a maximum grade of B+. Assignments received after 24 hours of the due date will be eligible for a maximum grade of C+. Late assignments will not be accepted after 48 hours after the original due date.\nUse of the MSAF form will automatically move the due date 72 hours, with no other possibility of extension or late submission without additional confirmation of the circumstances by the Faculty advising office. If you use the MSAF form for an assignment, you do not need to email me. Just turn in the assignment within 72 hours via Avenue or to the Political Science office (KTH 527). There is a drop box for after hours.\n\n\nOther policies\nSee the PDF version of the syllabus for McMaster University policies that may apply to this course."
