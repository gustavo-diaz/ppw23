title: "Week 14: Flex Class or Open Lab"

## Overview

We are leaving one empty spot in our schedule just in case, we can use our time this week in four ways:

1. Catch up on missed content due to unforeseen circumstances
2. Learn more about a topic that caught our attention during the semester
3. Discuss steps to learn more about the topic of this class or to take advantage of what you learned this semester
4. Have an unstructured lab session so we can work on final projects and help each other out

These are not mutually exclusive. We will collectively decide what to do and I will update this page accordingly.
