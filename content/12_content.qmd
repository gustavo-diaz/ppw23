## Overview

I have to cancel our meeting for this week. The course content has shifted one week.

You can participate in the following optional activities to improve your grade:

- Redo one of your previously submitted labs, or complete a lab that you missed

- Submit a response paper for one of the weeks that you may have missed

You can do up to one lab and up to one response paper. These are due on **April 2 at 11:59 PM.**

I hope this helps to make a smoother end of the semester.
