## Overview

We go over the course theme and requirements and discuss tips to succeed.

We will use some of the lab time exploring R and RStudio.

The lab assignment for this week is a freebie. You will complete a survey of research interests to help me organize groups for the final project and will get full points by just completing the survey.
