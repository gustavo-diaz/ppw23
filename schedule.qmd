This is an overview of the semester. As the semester goes on, I will update this page with links to slides, readings, and lab assignments.

You can also check the [Content](/content/) and [Labs](/labs/) pages for details.

```{r schedule, include = FALSE}
schedule =
  tribble(
    ~Week, ~Date, ~Content, ~Lab,
    1, "January 11", "Introduction", "[Research interests](link)" 
  )
```

<div class="centered-table">

```{r show-schedule, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
schedule %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "rlll",
               col.names = c("{{< fa hashtag >}} Week",
                             "{{< fa calendar >}} Date",
                             "{{< fa book-open-reader >}} Content",
                             "{{< fa laptop-code >}} Lab"))
```

</div>
